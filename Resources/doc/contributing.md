# Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). If you don't know
about any of them, you should really read the recommendations. Can't wait? Use the [PHP-CS-Fixer tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).

You SHOULD write documentation.

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains
why you are creating it.

Thank you!
